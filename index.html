<h2>My Background!</h2>
<p> I'm an up-and-coming software engineer from Gainesville, Florida with a background in competitive eSports.</p>
<p>I was sponsored as a Brand Ambassador and Competitor for Noble eSports for over half a decade!</p>
<p>My old career, by nature, involved a lot of meticulous design analysis and breakdown under high pressure situations.</p>
<p>That acuity now translates directly into coding and solid problem-solving efficacy in my field.</p>

<h2>About My Strengths!</h2>
<h3>Here's what I'll be bringing to your table if you hire me:</h3>
<ul class="align-left">
<!-- we choose emphasise here over <i> for greater search relevance and signifigance -->
<em>
<li>Tackling problematic scripting demands to not only meet function, but form!</li>
<li>Quick, effective, and adaptive learning ready to roll with any punch!</li>
<li>A self-motivated competitive drive guaranteed to leave you with a winning end-product!</li>
<li>Top-level teamwork!</li>

<!-- Cancel Border here removes the default border around images set for the page, here we pull up a logo.
